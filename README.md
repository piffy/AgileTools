# AgileTools

This is my public page for my Agile Tool Survey project.

This survey intends to find out which are the most used and beloved digital tools in use by the Agile Community, taking cultural differences into account. It is part of a research promoted by the University of Bologna, Innopolis, and Modena-Reggio Emilia. 
The actual survey form is hosted on Google Forms. Depending on your mother language (NOT YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE), you should visit the proper localized version as follows: 

* THE ENGLISH VERSION: http://bit.ly/2grLHFP (Corrected)
* THE ITALIAN VERSION: http://bit.ly/IT-2eJ25jv
* THE CHINESE VERSION: http://bit.ly/CN-2f61BQF0 (Thanks to Song Zhu)
* THE JAPANESE VERSION: http://bit.ly/-JP2eopQJZ0
* THE RUSSIAN VERSION: http://bit.ly/RU-2ftAnb41
* THE FARSI VERSION: http://bit.ly/FA-2flk9zS (Thanks to Sheila Mossammamy)
* THE SPANISH VERSION: http://bit.ly/ES-2f3VDR8 (Thanks to Patrizia Pini)
* THE ARABIC VERSION: http://bit.ly/AR-2guEcdG 
* THE GERMAN VERSION: http://bit.ly/DE-2fOcef7
* THE FRENCH VERSION: http://bit.ly/FR-2fz84Yb

My plan is to maximize the diffusion of this form. I will start by contacting the proper User Groups on Scrumalliance, Google and Linkedin. Suggestions are welcome (open an issue). 

I can add more languages (for example, Portuguese and Hebrew), but in this case I need your cooperation. Open an issue or send me a message.  

If you find something wrong in the surveys, again open an issue!

Results will be posted here in late 2017. 

Thank you for your time.
