# AgileTools

This is my public page for my Agile Tool Survey project.

This survey intends to find out which are the most used and beloved digital tools in use by the Agile Community, taking cultural differences into account. It is part of a research promoted by the University of Bologna. 
The actual survey form is hosted on Google Forms. Depending on your mother language, you should visit the proper localized version as follows: 

* THE ENGLISH VERSION: http://bit.ly/EN-2fk0PEH0
* THE ITALIAN VERSION: http://bit.ly/IT-2eJ25jv
* THE CHINESE VERSION: http://bit.ly/CN-2f61BQF0
* THE JAPANESE VERSION: http://bit.ly/-JP2eopQJZ0
* THE RUSSIAN VERSION: http://bit.ly/RU-2ftAnb41
* THE SPANISH VERSION: http://bit.ly/ES-2f3VDR8

My plan is to maximize the diffusion of this form. I will starf by contating the proper User Groups on Scrumalliance, Google and Linkedin. Suggestions are welcome (open an issue). 

If you find something wrong in the surveys, again open an issue!

Results will be posted here in late 2017. 

Thank you for your time.
